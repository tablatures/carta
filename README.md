## Logos

### Shape

The "Two overlapped circles" (â¦¾) logo represents the sound hole of acoustic guitars, as well as the [chromatic circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths) of music theory.

### Colors

The color used for the logos are `#8C52FF` for light purple and `#5E17EB` for deep purple.

### Sizes

Logos must always maintain the same aspect ratio. They are designed to have a square shape.

They are available in several sizes:

| Size | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Big  |  900x900 px |
| Medium  | 512x512 px  |
| Small  |  192x192 px |

## Typography

The rich font used for logos and important content (titles, subtitles...) is [Vollkorn](https://github.com/FAlthausen/Vollkorn-Typeface) by Friedrich Althausen.

The monofont used to display code and raw content is [Inconsolata](https://github.com/googlefonts/Inconsolata) by Raph Levien.

Both fonts are available under the [SIL Open Font License (OFL)](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL).
